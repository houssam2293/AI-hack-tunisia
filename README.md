The AI Hack Tunisia 2019 is the biggest ML/AI Hackathon ever in Tunisia, Africa, and the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. It takes place on 20-22 September. The event is a double hackathon: the first part is an individual Machine Learning Challenge, and the second part is a group competition focused on a specific technology.
